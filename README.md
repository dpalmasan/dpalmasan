## üëã About Me

Hello, my name is Diego Palma, and I am kind of a software developer. I am from Chile and I ‚ù§Ô∏è open-source. I hold an **M.Sc in Computer Science** from [University of Concepci√≥n](https://www.udec.cl/pexterno/) and during this masters, I worked mainly on Natural Language Processing (NLP). Actually, a product from my thesis was the paper [Coherence-Based Automatic Essay Assessment](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8506398).

I strongly believe that education should be available for everyone, and one of my goals is to contribute to education in the reading comprehension field. I created [TRUNAJOD](https://github.com/dpalmasan/TRUNAJOD2.0) which is an open-source library for text-complexity assessment.
